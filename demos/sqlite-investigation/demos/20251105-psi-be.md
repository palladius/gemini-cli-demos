## Step 2

I'm at an Hackathon event today with PSI SOftware Berlin.

Ok, let’s now add a person (Riccardo Carlesso, make up a sample email for me) and I’m coming to this event (as per event link). Also make sure I attend (subscribe) this event. Also add presenters for the event (a chap named Daniel Strebel, I presume).

Finally add Jasper Bernhardt. 

Again fake email, as its just a demo.
