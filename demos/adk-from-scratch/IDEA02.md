Another idea, half baked in my ADK simple workshop is this:

# Idea 2

the idea is to start creating it WITHOUT anything, see it makes mistakes...

1. download adk
2.  add `llms-full.txt` to gemini context - in https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/llms-full.txt
3. if it doesnt work, try  `context7` MCP
4. if it doesnt work, try reading the entire docs from inside the repo.

.. and then see it work!
