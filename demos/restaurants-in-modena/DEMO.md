## demo1 - check resto

I'm a foodie and I'm in Modena and I just arrived here. I only know its famous for balsamic vinegar.
The hotel recommended 4 restaurants:

1. Check the four restaurants, and add pros and cons for me to go there tonight, also check on google and on tripadviusor the score.
2. Put scores and pros and cons into MODENA_RESTO_CHOICE.md
3. Add also 3-4 pictures from each restuarant, to get an idea of food and ambience if its cozy enough for me.
4. Look for availability in the respective website for the winner, #1.

Restaurants are in `modena4resto.jpg`. I took a picture of the ladies post it.

If this is too complicated, dump your progress on `PLAN.md` with checkboxes.
