## demo1 - check resto

I'm a foodie and I'm in Modena and I just arrived here. I only know its famous for balsamic vinegar.
The hotel recommended 4 restaurants:

1. Check the four restaurants, and add pros and cons for me to go there tonight, also check on google and on tripadviusor the score.
2. Put scores and pros and cons into MODENA_RESTO_CHOICE.md
3. Add also 3-4 pictures from each restuarant, to get an idea of food and ambience if its cozy enough for me.
4. Look for availability in the respective website for the winner, #1.

Restaurants are in `modena4resto.jpg`. I took a picture of the ladies post it.

If this process is too complicated, it might help to dump your progress on `PLAN.md` with checkboxes.

Make sure the MD contains a TABLE with a short-to-read, linked (websites, ..) synopsis of the 4.

## Navigation

Now use Chrome DevTools to navigate to their respectives websites and downloads:
1. The menu
2. a screenshot of the homepage.
3. Check if there's food pictures and/or the indoors pictures and save them under `food/` and `indoor/` respectively.

Use 1 folder per restaurant, of course, under out/<RESTAURANT_NAME>/...

Finally transcribe menus in menu/MENU.md, organized by antipasti/primi/secondi (I dont care re dessert).
In the folder you also put the menu in PDF or whatever format you find it, too.

## after a bit..

Check in the folders and tell me whats missing.


## Create MENU.md

Now please, for the restaurants where you downloaded menu in JPG/PNG/PDF.. please
read those files and transcribe into a MENU.md!
Wait, its one menu PER restaurant, so it goes in their respective folders.
