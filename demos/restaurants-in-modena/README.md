# Modena Restaurant Investigator Demo

This demo is a conceptual plan for using an AI assistant to research and select the best restaurant in Modena, Italy from a predefined list.

## Purpose

The goal is to simulate a research task where an AI assistant would:
1.  Gather information (reviews, scores, images) for a list of restaurants.
2.  Analyze the collected data to choose the best option.
3.  Generate a final report with the recommendation.
4.  Check for reservation availability.

## Directory Structure

*   `PLAN.md`: Outlines the step-by-step research plan for the assistant to follow.
*   `modena4resto.jpg`: An inspirational image for the project.
*   `docs/`: (Currently empty) Intended for additional documentation.
*   `out/`: (Currently empty) Intended to store the output of the research, such as the final `MODENA_RESTO_CHOICE.md` report.

## How to Use

This is a conceptual demo and does not contain runnable scripts. The `PLAN.md` serves as a set of instructions for an AI assistant to execute.
