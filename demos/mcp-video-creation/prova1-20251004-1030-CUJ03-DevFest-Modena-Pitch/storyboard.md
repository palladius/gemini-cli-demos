# Storyboard: Gemini CLI: Your AI-Powered Software Engineering Sidekick

## Style:
Modern, dynamic, tech-focused, slightly futuristic, and inspiring. The visuals should be clean, with a focus on user interfaces, code snippets, and abstract representations of AI.

## Characters:
*   **The Developer:** A diverse, energetic software engineer, representing the target audience. They are shown interacting with the Gemini CLI, looking productive and engaged.
*   **Gemini CLI (represented visually):** Abstract visual elements (e.g., glowing lines, data streams, subtle AI iconography) that represent the intelligent assistance of the Gemini CLI.
