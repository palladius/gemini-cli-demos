    * Riccardo speaks at 12:45 on track 2.

the Demos should be in English, or assume an English audience.
* Writing should be in English.
* However, the video for the demo02 shuld be in Italian, since we're aiming at sharing on linkedin the day before (hence majority of italian audience).
* At the demo of tomorrow, people won't mind since its more about how i created it rather than the actual content.
