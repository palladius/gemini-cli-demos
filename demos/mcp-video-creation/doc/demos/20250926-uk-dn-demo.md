This file was brutally copied from another repo.
It didnt go well as it implied we'd have to use §geniectl§. But not here :)

## COPY

Create a good night story for my son Alessandro, a Solihull-born lad from Birmingham (UK),
who's in love for Peaky Blinders and Game of Thrones.

Make it spooky but remember my son is only 7y old.

He speaks Italian, English and German.

Use folder `out/uk-demo02/`.

Create a TXT story in english (`story-en.txt`), then translate it to Italian and German.

Also create a sound for each story and name it appropriately.

All files should be in the same folder!

## Note on geniectl

DO NOT use `geniectl` logic or software AT ALL in this demo.
Just use MCP to do it.
