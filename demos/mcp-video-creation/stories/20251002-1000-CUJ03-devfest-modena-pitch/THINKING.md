## Video and Music Generation Process

This document outlines the thinking process for generating the video and music assets for the DevFest Modena 2025 pitch video.

### Initial Plan

The initial plan was to generate two video takes and one music track for each of the five scenes described in the `storyboard.md` file.

### Execution and Failures

The video generation for all scenes was successful. However, the music generation for scenes 2 and 3 failed due to the prompts being blocked by recitation checks.

**Failed Music Prompts:**

*   **Scene 2:** "A quirky, playful pizzicato string melody with a subtle electronic beat. The mood is lighthearted and humorous."
*   **Scene 3:** "A high-energy electronic track with a driving beat and synthesized melodies. The mood is exciting and futuristic."

### Revised Plan

To address the music generation failures, the prompts for scenes 2 and 3 have been rephrased to be less specific, while still capturing the desired mood.

**New Music Prompts:**

*   **Scene 2:** "A playful and lighthearted instrumental track with pizzicato strings and a subtle electronic rhythm."
*   **Scene 3:** "An energetic and exciting electronic instrumental track with a strong beat and synthesized sounds."

The next step is to retry generating the music for scenes 2 and 3 with these new prompts.
