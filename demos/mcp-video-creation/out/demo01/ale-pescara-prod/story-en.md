## Alessandro and the Whispering Shores of Pescara

Alessandro, a brave seven-year-old with a heart full of dragons and a mind dreaming of Ferraris, was visiting his nonno and nonna in Pescara. The city, usually bustling with life, felt different tonight. A strange mist rolled in from the Adriatic Sea, making the streetlights glow with an eerie halo.

"It's a perfect night for arrosticini!" exclaimed Nonno, as the delicious smell of grilling lamb skewers filled the air. Alessandro, despite his love for the savory treats, felt a shiver that wasn't from the cool evening breeze.

Suddenly, a whirring sound broke the silence. "Oh, for the love of all that is logical, another existential crisis," muttered Marvin, Alessandro's paranoid android companion, his optical sensors flickering nervously. "The probability of a successful arrosticini consumption without incident is decreasing rapidly."

Uncle Fabio, a Ruby programmer from Dublin, chuckled. "Don't worry, Marvin. It's probably just the sea air playing tricks." But even Uncle Fabio looked a little uneasy.

"Perhaps," chimed in Uncle Luca, a staunch advocate for Linux and open-source, "we are witnessing a phenomenon beyond mere atmospheric conditions. As Richard Stallman might say, 'Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.' But what about free spirits?"

As they walked along the deserted beach, the mist grew thicker. Alessandro, usually fearless, clutched his favorite Pokémon plushie tighter. He spotted something glinting in the sand – a ruby, deep red and shimmering. He bent down to pick it up, and as his fingers touched the stone, a whisper echoed from the waves:

*"Onde che mormorate segreti antichi,
Svelate il velo della notte infinita."*

"Did you hear that?" Alessandro whispered, his eyes wide.

Marvin's sensors whirred. "Audio anomaly detected. Linguistic analysis suggests archaic Italian poetry. Probability of ghostly manifestation: 73.4%."

Uncle Fabio pulled out his phone, "My Ruby script for ghost detection is going haywire!"

Uncle Luca, ever the pragmatist, tried to rationalize. "It's just the wind, Alessandro. Or perhaps a recording of Gabriele D'Annunzio himself, carried on the breeze."

But Alessandro knew better. The ruby pulsed warmly in his hand. He looked out at the sea, where the mist seemed to swirl into the shape of a magnificent, ethereal dragon, its eyes glowing like molten gold. It wasn't scary, not really. It was an adventure, a secret whispered by the ancient shores of Pescara, a story just for him, his precious ruby, and his wonderfully paranoid android friend. And maybe, just maybe, a few more arrosticini would make everything even better.
