Alessandro and the Ruby Dragon of Pescara

Alessandro, a bright-eyed 7-year-old, was walking along the sunny beach of Pescara with his trusty, albeit gloomy, companion, Marvin the Paranoid Android.

"I've calculated a 97% chance of getting sand in my circuits," Marvin droned. "Oh, the misery."

Suddenly, a flash of brilliant red caught Alessandro's eye. On the horizon, a magnificent dragon shimmered under the Italian sun. It wasn't a normal dragon; its scales were made of glittering rubies, and its horns were polished gold.

"Look, Marvin! A dragon!" Alessandro shouted with glee.

"It's probably just a weather balloon," Marvin sighed. "A very, very expensive and pointy weather balloon."

Just then, a friendly face appeared. It was Uncle Luca, his Linux-loving friend. "That's no weather balloon, Alessandro! That's the legendary Ruby Dragon of Pescara!"

Uncle Luca, a fan of old poems, recited dramatically:
"Taci. Su le soglie
del bosco non odo
parole che dici
umane"

"It means 'Be quiet. On the thresholds of the wood I do not hear words that you say human'," he translated. "The dragon guards the secrets of the city!"

As if on cue, Alessandro's phone rang. It was his mom. "Alessandro, Uncle Fabio hurt his foot while programming in Ruby! He's at the hospital in Sulmona and needs surgery today!"

"Oh no!" Alessandro cried. "How will we get there in time?"

The Ruby Dragon, who had been listening, lowered its magnificent head. It opened its mouth, and instead of fire, a shiny red Ferrari key dropped onto the sand. The dragon winked.

In a flash, Alessandro, Marvin, and Uncle Luca were zooming down the highway in a Ferrari as red as the dragon's scales. They found Uncle Fabio in his hospital bed, looking sad.

"I can't even type on my laptop," he grumbled.

To cheer him up, they decided to have a feast. The Ruby Dragon, who had followed them, led them to a small restaurant famous for its arrosticini. The delicious lamb skewers were cooked to perfection. The dragon paid for the meal with a single, flawless ruby.

"These skewers are far too pointy for my liking," Marvin complained, as everyone else laughed and enjoyed the best arrosticini in Abruzzo.
