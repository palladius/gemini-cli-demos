## Alessandro and the Quest for the Ruby Arrosticino

Alessandro, a boy with a heart full of adventure and pockets full of shiny pebbles, was exploring Pescara with his uncles, Fabio and Luca. Of course, his trusty (and rusty) robot companion, Marvin the Paranoid Android, was there too, sighing dramatically.

"I have a million things to worry about," Marvin droned, "and now we're looking for... pointy meat on a stick. How utterly depressing."

"They're not just pointy meat!" Alessandro laughed, his eyes sparkling like the gold he loved. "We're looking for the legendary Ruby Arrosticino! It's said to be as red as a Ferrari and as shiny as a dragon's eye!"

Uncle Fabio, who programmed in a language called Ruby, was intrigued. "A Ruby Arrosticino, you say? Now that's a gem I'd like to find!"

Uncle Luca, a fan of all things open and free, added, "The best things in life are shared, like good food and good code. Let's find this arrosticino for everyone!"

Their quest led them to an old house, the birthplace of a famous poet named Gabriele D'Annunzio. A plaque on the wall had a quote:

> "O piove su le tue ciglia, Ermione,
> piove su le tue ciglia nere..."

"Rain on your eyelashes... black eyelashes," Marvin translated gloomily. "It's probably going to rain. Another thing to worry about."

But Alessandro saw something else. Hidden in the carving was a tiny dragon, pointing towards the sea. "Look! A clue! The dragon knows the way!"

They followed the direction of the tiny dragon, down to the beach. The smell of grilled meat filled the air. They found a cave, and inside, a huge pile of arrosticini, glowing with a warm, red light. Guarding them was a grumpy-looking dragon, smoke puffing from his nostrils.

"Oh, wonderful," Marvin sighed. "A dragon. We're doomed. I told you this was a bad idea."

But Alessandro wasn't scared. He loved dragons. He walked closer, holding out his hand. "You have beautiful scales," he said. "They're like rubies."

The dragon stopped puffing smoke and looked at Alessandro. "You're not scared?" he rumbled.

"No! You're amazing! Why are you hiding all these arrosticini?"

The dragon looked sad. "I'm lonely," he admitted. "I thought if I had all the best arrosticini, someone would come and visit me."

Alessandro smiled. "We'll be your friends!" he declared. "And we can share the arrosticini with everyone in Pescara!"

So they did. The dragon, whose name was Ferruccio, became the most popular chef in Pescara, grilling his ruby-red arrosticini for everyone. Alessandro got to ride on Ferruccio's back, flying over the city in a blur of red, just like a Ferrari.

And even Marvin had to admit, as he nibbled on a perfectly grilled arrosticino, "Well, I suppose it's not the *worst* thing that's ever happened to me."
