    <p>Alessandro, a seven-year-old boy with a mind full of dragons and fast cars, was on the sunny beach of Pescara. With him was Marvin, a small, perpetually gloomy robot who was his constant companion.</p>

    <p>"I hate sand," Marvin grumbled, his metallic voice full of despair. "It gets everywhere. We're all doomed to be slightly gritty forever."</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a familiar voice called out. "What have you got there, Ale?" It was Uncle Luca, his laptop open, a penguin sticker proudly displayed on the lid. He was a fan of something called 'Linux' and 'Open Source'.</p>

    <p>Alessandro showed him the stone. Uncle Luca's eyes twinkled. "They say a great dragon sleeps beneath the Gran Sasso mountain, guarding a treasure of gold and rubies. But he is a strange dragon, they say he is scared by the smell of arrosticini" He then looked out at the sea and recited, in a dramatic voice:</p>

    <blockquote>"O pioppi, pioppi, del bel fiume adorno,<br>eccelsi eroi di solitaria grandezza!"</blockquote>

    <p>Marvin beeped. "The probability of a dragon being scared by grilled lamb skewers is infinitesimal. And poetry? Don't get me started."</p>

    <p>Just then, Uncle Luca's phone rang. His face grew serious. "Oh no! It's your Uncle Fabio. He was in Dublin, programming with something called 'Ruby', and he hurt his foot! He's flown back and is in the hospital in Sulmona. He needs an operation today!"</p>

    <p>Alessandro's eyes widened. Sulmona was near the mountains! "We have to go see him! And maybe... maybe we'll see the dragon!"</p>

    <p>Their journey to Sulmona was filled with the delicious smell of arrosticini from a roadside stall. They bought a huge bunch. "Aha!" said Alessandro, waving a skewer. "Dragon repellent!" Marvin just sighed, "I'm a robot surrounded by greasy smoke. The universe is actively trying to make me miserable."</p>

    <p>They finally reached the hospital in Sulmona. They found Uncle Fabio in a bed, his foot propped up on a pillow, looking very sorry for himself.</p>

    <p>"Uncle Fabio, are you okay?" asked Alessandro.</p>

    <p>Fabio managed a weak smile. "I'm okay, Ale. It was a silly accident. I was working on a big project, a 'Ruby gem' as we call it in programming, and I got so excited I jumped up and slipped..." He paused, then pointed to a small, familiar-looking red stone on his bedside table. "...I slipped on the toy ruby you left in my office in Dublin!"</p>

    <p>Alessandro gasped, then started to giggle. Uncle Luca chuckled. Even Marvin made a sound that was almost like a laugh. The scary dragon of Pescara was just a toy stone!</p>

    <p>"Since you came all this way," Uncle Fabio said, handing Alessandro the stone, "you should have it. It's a real ruby, a small one. A reward for being such a brave dragon hunter."</p>

    <p>Alessandro held the ruby tightly. He had found his treasure, visited his uncle, and eaten lots of arrosticini. It had been a scary, but wonderful, adventure.</p>

    <p>"Well," Marvin said, as they left the hospital. "At least we're not being chased by a dragon. I suppose that's something. But I'm still probably going to rust."</p>
