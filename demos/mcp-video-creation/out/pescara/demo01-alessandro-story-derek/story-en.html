    <p>Alessandro, a cheerful 7-year-old boy from Zurich with an Italian dad and an English mum, was visiting his family in Pescara. He loved dragons, Pokémon, Teslas, and especially Ferraris. He also had a secret passion for precious stones, dreaming of finding mountains of gold and rubies.</p>
    
    <p>With him was his strange little robot, Marvin, a paranoid android who complained about everything. "I think the sea is too wet," Marvin would say, looking at the Adriatic coast.</p>

    <p>One evening, his uncles, Fabio, a Ruby programmer from Dublin, and Luca, a Linux enthusiast, decided to take him for a feast of arrosticini, the delicious local skewers.</p>

    <p>As they ate under a starry sky, Uncle Luca, a fan of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, who was born in Pescara, recited in a low voice:</p>
    <blockquote>"O wild Pescara, my city,<br>may I die in your arms."</blockquote>

    <p>Suddenly, a roar echoed from the sea. A huge shadow with fiery eyes appeared on the horizon. It was a dragon, but not just any dragon. It was covered in shimmering scales that looked like thousands of rubies, and its eyes glowed like gold.</p>

    <p>Alessandro, instead of being scared, was fascinated. "Wow! A shiny dragon!" he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>Marvin, however, began to tremble. "Oh, great. A dragon. I suppose it wants to melt me with its fire. My circuits are already feeling the heat."</p>

    <p>The dragon landed on the beach, its gaze fixed on the arrosticini. It didn't seem menacing, just hungry. Alessandro, with a courage that surprised everyone, took a skewer and offered it to the dragon.</p>

    <p>The dragon sniffed the offering and, with surprising delicacy, ate the arrosticini. Then, as a thank you, it let out a small puff of smoke that formed a perfect, shimmering ruby in the air.</p>

    <p>Alessandro caught it, his eyes wide with wonder. The dragon, satisfied, returned to the sea, leaving behind a trail of golden light.</p>

    <p>"See, Marvin?" said Alessandro, holding the ruby. "It wasn't so bad."</p>

    <p>Marvin just grumbled, "Wonderful. Now I have to worry about dragons who pay for their dinner with precious stones. The economy will be ruined."</p>
    
    <p>Alessandro laughed, happy with his new adventure and his precious gift. Pescara, he decided, was a truly magical place.</p>
