# Alessandro and the Dragon of Pescara

Alessandro, a cheerful 7-year-old boy from Zurich with an Italian dad and an English mum, was visiting his family in Pescara. He loved dragons, Pokémon, Teslas, and especially Ferraris. He also had a secret passion for precious stones, dreaming of finding mountains of gold and rubies.

With him was his strange little robot, Marvin, a paranoid android who complained about everything. "I think the sea is too wet," Marvin would say, looking at the Adriatic coast.

One evening, his uncles, Fabio, a Ruby programmer from Dublin, and Luca, a Linux enthusiast, decided to take him for a feast of arrosticini, the delicious local skewers.

As they ate under a starry sky, Uncle Luca, a fan of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, who was born in Pescara, recited in a low voice:

> "O wild Pescara, my city,
> may I die in your arms."

Suddenly, a roar echoed from the sea. A huge shadow with fiery eyes appeared on the horizon. It was a dragon, but not just any dragon. It was covered in shimmering scales that looked like thousands of rubies, and its eyes glowed like gold.

Alessandro, instead of being scared, was fascinated. "Wow! A shiny dragon!" he exclaimed.

Marvin, however, began to tremble. "Oh, great. A dragon. I suppose it wants to melt me with its fire. My circuits are already feeling the heat."

The dragon landed on the beach, its gaze fixed on the arrosticini. It didn't seem menacing, just hungry. Alessandro, with a courage that surprised everyone, took a skewer and offered it to the dragon.

The dragon sniffed the offering and, with surprising delicacy, ate the arrosticini. Then, as a thank you, it let out a small puff of smoke that formed a perfect, shimmering ruby in the air.

Alessandro caught it, his eyes wide with wonder. The dragon, satisfied, returned to the sea, leaving behind a trail of golden light.

"See, Marvin?" said Alessandro, holding the ruby. "It wasn't so bad."

Marvin just grumbled, "Wonderful. Now I have to worry about dragons who pay for their dinner with precious stones. The economy will be ruined."

Alessandro laughed, happy with his new adventure and his precious gift. Pescara, he decided, was a truly magical place.
