# Alessandro and the Ruby-Red Dragon of Pescara

Alessandro, a seven-year-old boy with a mind full of dragons and fast cars, was walking along the sunny coast of Pescara. Beside him hovered Marvin, his personal paranoid android, who was calculating the chances of a seagull stealing his shiny antenna. "The probability is a distressingly high 3,457,899 to one," Marvin sighed.

"Don't worry, Marvin," Alessandro said, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "We're in Italy! We're going to eat arrosticini!"

They met up with two of his father's friends, Uncle Fabio and Uncle Luca, near the futuristic Ponte del Mare. Uncle Fabio, a cheerful programmer from Dublin, was talking about his latest Ruby project, while Uncle Luca, a staunch supporter of open-source, was explaining why Linux was like a digital Ferrari.

"Arrosticini time!" announced Uncle Luca, and they found a small outdoor place where the smell of grilled lamb skewers filled the air. Alessandro's mouth watered as he saw hundreds of them cooking over a long grill.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over them. A huge, red creature with eyes like glowing coals and teeth like daggers stood before them. It looked like a dragon, a ruby-red dragon, and it was staring right at the arrosticini.

"Oh, doom," Marvin droned. "A dragon. I knew it. The universe is rarely so lazy as to miss an opportunity for my personal misery."

Uncle Fabio laughed nervously. "I'm sure I could write a Ruby script to interface with its... uh... dragon-ness?"

"Nonsense," countered Uncle Luca. "The solution is open-source! We just need to share one of our arrosticini with it."

But Alessandro, brave as always, noticed a collar around the dragon's neck. He slowly approached the creature, his heart beating like a drum. The "dragon" was just a very large, very red dog. On its tag was a name, "Vate," and two lines of poetry:

> "Su la riva la canna si piega
> se il vento la tocca appena..."

"That's from a poem by Gabriele D'Annunzio!" exclaimed a man running towards them. He was the dog's owner. "Vate loves the smell of arrosticini! Thank you for finding him!"

To thank them, the man bought them all the arrosticini they could eat. Alessandro ate so many he felt as full as a treasure chest of gold and rubies. As they left, he imagined driving back to Zurich not in a Tesla, but in a roaring red Ferrari, with Marvin complaining about the G-forces in the back seat.
