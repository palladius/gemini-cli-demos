# Storyboard: Cloud Day Milan Teaser

## Scene 1: The Calm Before

**Visual:** A breathtaking, cinematic, wide-angle shot of the Duomo di Milano at dawn. The sky is a beautiful mix of orange, pink, and blue. The piazza is empty and peaceful. A small, colorful, mischievous, Pixar-style monster is subtly hidden in the intricate architecture of the Duomo's facade. The style is hyperrealistic with a touch of fantasy.

**Video:** The camera slowly zooms in on the Duomo di Milano, with the city slowly waking up. The hidden monster subtly peeks out and then quickly hides again. The overall feeling is cinematic and mysterious.

**Music:** A calm, atmospheric, and slightly mysterious cinematic score. The music should evoke a sense of wonder and a hint of unseen things. Use orchestral strings and a gentle piano melody. The tempo is slow and contemplative.

**Voiceover (Italian):** "Milano si sveglia, ignara dei mostri che si nascondono nell'ombra."
