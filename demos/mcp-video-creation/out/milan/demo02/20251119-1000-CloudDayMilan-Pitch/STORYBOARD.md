# Storyboard: Cloud Day Milan Teaser

## Scene 1: The Calm Before

**Visual:** A breathtaking, cinematic, wide-angle shot of the Duomo di Milano at dawn. The sky is a beautiful mix of orange, pink, and blue. The piazza is empty and peaceful. A small, colorful, mischievous, Pixar-style monster is subtly hidden in the intricate architecture of the Duomo's facade. The style is hyperrealistic with a touch of fantasy.

**Video:** The camera slowly zooms in on the Duomo di Milano, with the city slowly waking up. The hidden monster subtly peeks out and then quickly hides again. The overall feeling is cinematic and mysterious.

**Music:** A calm, atmospheric, and slightly mysterious cinematic score. The music should evoke a sense of wonder and a hint of unseen things. Use orchestral strings and a gentle piano melody. The tempo is slow and contemplative.

**Voiceover (Italian):** "Milano si sveglia, ignara dei mostri che si nascondono nell'ombra."

## Scene 2: The Hidden Threat

**Visual:** A vibrant, cinematic shot of a classic Milanese aperitivo on a rooftop terrace at sunset, with the city skyline in the background. A diverse group of stylishly dressed people are chatting and enjoying drinks. In the scene, three small, colorful, mischievous, Pixar-style monsters are playfully causing minor tech-related disruptions. One monster is tangled in a pair of headphones, another is sitting on a laptop, its screen glitching with colorful patterns, and a third is unplugging a phone charger. The overall mood is lively and fashionable, with a hint of humorous technological chaos.

**Video:** The camera pans across the lively aperitivo scene. The monsters' playful disruptions cause a ripple of funny, minor chaos. People are laughing and reacting to the glitches with amusement. The scene is dynamic and humorous.

**Music:** An upbeat, slightly tense, and mischievous cinematic score. The music should feature pizzicato strings, playful woodwinds, and a driving rhythm. It should create a sense of humorous chaos and impending action. The style is reminiscent of a spy movie with a comedic twist.

**Voiceover (Italian):** "Piccoli problemi, grandi impatti. La tecnologia a volte può essere un mostro."

## Scene 3: The Agents Assemble

**Visual:** A cinematic, low-angle shot of the entrance to the Talent Garden Calabiana in Milan. A diverse group of developers, three men and two women, are dressed in the "Men in Black" style: crisp black suits, white shirts, and dark sunglasses. They walk confidently and purposefully towards the modern entrance of the building. One of the agents, a woman in the foreground, briefly holds up a silver MIB-style neuralyzer. A sleek banner with the Google logo and "Cloud Day Milan" is visible next to the entrance. The lighting is dramatic, and the mood is cool, competent, and heroic.

**Video:** The group of developers walks towards the camera in slow motion, looking confident and heroic. The woman with the neuralyzer gives a subtle, knowing smile to the camera. The shot is powerful and inspiring, with a sense of mission.

**Music:** A heroic, upbeat, and inspiring cinematic theme reminiscent of the "Men in Black" soundtrack. The music should be grand and orchestral, with a powerful brass section, a driving percussion beat, and a memorable, triumphant melody. It should create a sense of excitement, competence, and adventure.

**Voiceover (Italian):** "Ma non temete. Gli agenti del Cloud Day sono pronti a domare ogni mostro. Unitevi a noi."
