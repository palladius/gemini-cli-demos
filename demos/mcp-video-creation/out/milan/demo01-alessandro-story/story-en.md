Alessandro, a brave 7-year-old from Zurich, was walking through Milan with his Italian papino and his English mummy. Tucked under his arm was his trusty, but gloomy, mascot, Marvin the Paranoid Android. "I've calculated a 98% chance of this walk ending in utter boredom," Marvin droned.

"Don't be silly, Marvin!" Alessandro laughed. "We're going to meet Uncle Alfredo!"

They found papino and Uncle Alfredo near the Duomo, both wearing bright yellow scarves. They were admiring a brilliant yellow Ferrari parked by the curb. "What a magnificent shade of Giallo Modena!" said papino, his eyes gleaming.

"It's the color of pure happiness!" agreed Uncle Alfredo, giving Alessandro a big hug.

For dinner, they went to a restaurant that served a famous risotto alla milanese. When the waiter brought the dish, it was a beautiful, golden-yellow color, shimmering under the lights. Papino and Uncle Alfredo were delighted. "A feast for the eyes and the stomach!" they cheered.

As they ate the delicious, creamy risotto, mummy looked up at the magnificent cathedral. "You know," she said softly, "they say a dragon sleeps among the spires of the Duomo. A dragon guarding a treasure of gold and rubies."

Alessandro’s eyes went wide. A real-life dragon, like a Charizard or a Dragonite!

Later that night, as they walked past the Duomo, a low, sad rumble echoed from the cathedral roof. Marvin began to shake. "Oh dear," he whimpered. "That sounds suspiciously like a large, lonely, and potentially carnivorous creature. This is how it ends."

Suddenly, a huge, shadowy figure with glowing red eyes appeared on the roof. It was a dragon, and its scales shimmered like a thousand rubies in the moonlight. But it didn't look scary. It looked sad.

"What's the matter, Mr. Dragon?" Alessandro called out bravely.

The dragon looked down, surprised that a little boy was talking to him. "I'm lonely," his deep voice rumbled. "And I've lost my favorite toy, a shiny yellow Ferrari."

Alessandro gasped. A yellow Ferrari! Just like the one his papino and Uncle Alfredo loved. He knew he had to help. With his family, he searched the nearby streets and, with a bit of luck, they found the very same yellow toy car that had rolled under a bench.

They managed to get the toy back to the Duomo. Papino, who was very clever, tied it to a bunch of strong balloons from a street vendor, and they floated the little yellow car all the way up to the dragon on the roof.

The dragon was overjoyed. As a thank you, he showed them his secret hoard: a hidden chamber in the Duomo obfuscated from the modern world in the Duomo filled with glittering gold, sparkling rubies, and even a collection of old Teslas.

As they walked back to their hotel, papino smiled and quoted the great Milanese writer, Alessandro Manzoni:

> "Ma che sa il cuore? Appena un poco di quello che è già accaduto."

Alessandro didn't fully understand the Italian words, but he felt their importance. He had made a new friend, seen a real dragon's treasure, and had an adventure he would never, ever forget. And Marvin? He was still complaining, of course. "Wonderful. Now I'll probably have dragon dust in my circuits for weeks. The universe just loves to find new ways to annoy me."
