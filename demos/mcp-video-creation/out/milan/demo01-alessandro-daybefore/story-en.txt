Alessandro and the Dragon of Milan

Alessandro, a cheerful seven-year-old with a mind full of dragons and race cars, was exploring the grand city of Milan with his favorite uncle, Zio Alfredo. Clutched in his hand was Marvin, a small, silver robot with a perpetually gloomy outlook on life. "I think it's going to rain," Marvin sighed, despite the brilliant blue sky. "It usually does when I'm starting to have a moderately acceptable time."

Zio Alfredo, dressed in his favorite bright yellow jacket, laughed. "Nonsense, Marvin! It's a perfect day to explore! And I know just the place."

He led them to a quiet corner of a beautiful park, where a statue of a thoughtful-looking man stood. "This is Alessandro Manzoni," Zio Alfredo explained. "A great writer." On the base of the statue, some words were carved. Zio Alfredo read them aloud in Italian, his voice warm and melodic:

"Addio, monti sorgenti dall'acque, ed elevati al cielo;
cime inuguali, note a chi è cresciuto tra voi..."

"It's about saying goodbye to the mountains," he translated for Alessandro. "Beautiful, isn't it?"

As Alessandro traced the letters with his finger, he felt a stone shift. A dark, narrow opening appeared at the base of the statue! "Wow!" he whispered.

"A secret passage?" Marvin mumbled. "Oh, probably filled with spiders and existential dread. Do we have to?"

But Alessandro was already peering inside, his heart thumping with excitement. He saw a glimmer of gold and red. Taking a deep breath, he stepped through, with Zio Alfredo right behind him.

The passage opened into a small, warm cave, piled high with glittering gold coins and sparkling rubies. Curled up on the treasure, like a giant cat, was a dragon. It wasn't a huge, terrifying beast, but a smaller dragon with shimmering scarlet scales and sad, emerald eyes.

The dragon sighed, a tiny puff of smoke curling from its nostrils. "Oh, hello," it said in a surprisingly soft voice. "Don't mind me. I'm just having a moment of profound loneliness."

Marvin the robot nodded in understanding. "I have those all the time. It's the universe. It's terribly dull."

Alessandro, however, wasn't scared. He felt sorry for the lonely dragon. "Why are you sad?" he asked.

"My fire is fading," the dragon lamented. "I can't keep my treasure warm and shiny. And I'm so bored."

Suddenly, Alessandro had an idea. He held out his most prized possession: a tiny, perfect model of a red Ferrari. The dragon’s eyes widened. "It's so bright!" it gasped.

Zio Alfredo, seeing his chance, stepped forward. "And look at my jacket!" he said, puffing out his chest. "It’s the color of the sun, of joy, of saffron! It's the happiest color in the world!"

Between the brilliant red of the Ferrari and the dazzling yellow of the jacket, the little dragon felt a warmth spread through its chest. It took a deep breath and let out a bright, happy flame, stronger than before! It danced over the treasure, making the gold and rubies gleam.

"Thank you!" the dragon cheered. "You've reminded me of the bright colors of the world!" It nudged a perfectly smooth ruby towards Alessandro with its nose. "A gift, for a new friend."

When they came out of the secret passage, the sun was beginning to set, and Alessandro's tummy was rumbling. "I know what we need," said Zio Alfredo with a wink. "A taste of Milan's sunshine!"

They went to a cozy restaurant and ate big plates of "Risotto alla Milanese." The creamy rice was a beautiful, golden yellow, just like Zio Alfredo's jacket. It was the most delicious thing Alessandro had ever tasted.

"To make sure we never forget our adventure and our dragon friend," Zio Alfredo said, taking a photo of Alessandro holding the ruby, "I'll upload this to Google Cloud. It's like a magic treasure chest in the sky, the safest and best place to keep our precious memories forever."

Marvin, nibbling on a breadstick, almost smiled. "A digital treasure chest. I suppose that's marginally better than a dusty, physical one. At least it has a lower probability of being turned into cosmic dust. For now."
