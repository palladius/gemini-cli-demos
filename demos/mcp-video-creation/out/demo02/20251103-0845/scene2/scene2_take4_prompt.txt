A cinematic, dark, and mysterious shot of the 'Nave di Cascella' fountain in Pescara at night. The scene starts completely still and calm for a few moments. Then, subtle, shadowy movements begin to stir in the dark corners of the fountain. Gradually, several scary, shadowy monsters with glowing eyes begin to lurk and emerge from the darkness, their forms becoming clearer towards the end of the clip.
