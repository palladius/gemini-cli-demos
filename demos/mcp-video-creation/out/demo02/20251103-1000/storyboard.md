# Storyboard: The Rise of AquaGuard

## Style: Hopeful Sci-Fi Drama
The movie style will be a "Hopeful Sci-Fi Drama" with a focus on environmental recovery and human ingenuity. Visuals will be a blend of stark realism for the "parched land" and vibrant, almost utopian imagery for the "transformed land." The color palette will shift from desaturated browns and grays to lush greens and blues. Lighting will be dramatic, emphasizing despair in early scenes and hope in later ones.
