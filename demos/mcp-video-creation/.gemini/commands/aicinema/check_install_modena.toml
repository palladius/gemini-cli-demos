# Check MCP Veo Go Installation

## Instructions

1. Check if the `mcp-veo-go` tool is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ls ~/go/bin/mcp-*
# Expected:
mcp-avtool-go  mcp-gemini-go  mcp-lyria-go
mcp-chirp3-go  mcp-imagen-go  mcp-veo-go
```

2. Check if its in the local path. If not, add it to your PATH environment variable:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
```

3. Confirm ENV variables:

```bash
echo "PROJECT_ID: $PROJECT_ID"
echo "GENMEDIA_BUCKET: $GENMEDIA_BUCKET"
```

Note these are NOT strictly needed. Gemini needs them either in ENV or in `.gemini/settings.json`. (see step 4)

3. Verify the `.gemini/settings.json` is set up correctly with your Google Cloud project and authentication details.

4. Ensure PROJECT_ID and GENMEDIA_BUCKET are set in either your environment variables or in `.gemini/settings.json`.

5. Check `gcloud` is authenticated by running a very simple `gcloud` command, for example: `gcloud storage buckets list`.
   DO NOT authenticate unless you find its needed (output says "not authenticated" or similar). Auth is a SLOW and expensive
    operation for users, so only do it if needed.

6. Start invoking MCP `list_chirp_voices` to get the list of Chirp voices. This will check end2end that auth works.
   Show a list of italian ones, prepended by italian flag, and appropriate gender emoji for male/female.

7. Finally running a simple CHEAP command, the simplest and funniest way is to say
  "Non c'e' pezza, funge di brutto!" (and maybe something more elaborate afterwards, like "Non c'e' pezza, funge di brutto! Ho anche controllato X Y e Z, polpetta")
  and create a chirp file for it with any Italian voice you like,
  and call it "funge_di_brutto.wav". If this works, call some sort of `open funge_di_brutto.wav` to play the file in the local computer
  system (Mac / Linux / windows might have different ways to invoke this).
