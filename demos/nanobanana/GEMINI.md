Use `nanobanana` extension and MCP server to generate images.

* Use `src/` for source images
* Use `out/` for output images.
  * Note Nanobanana MCP tends to stubbornly put images in here: `nanobanana-output/`
* If user is impressed by an image, propose to move from out/ to src/

## Errors

If Nanobanana MCP is not available, instruct user to:

1. Follow instructions in https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana
2. Propose to run this for them: `gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana`
