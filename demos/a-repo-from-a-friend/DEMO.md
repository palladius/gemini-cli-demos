## Code understanding

```
Look at this repo suggested by a friend: https://github.com/Friends-of-Ricc/sandmold

1. Download it locally with `git clone` under random-repo/
2. Explain what it does
3. Create a RANDOM-REPO-README.md with what it does, and add 2 sections on Prerequsiites, and How to run it.
4. run it for me (if applicable: eg, if its app to run locally, or TF code to run in PLAN mode, and so on).
```

Explain to the audience: this prompt seems a good candidate for transforming this into a Custom Command...
Let's discuss this later.


## Lets do more

```
1. The README is boring. Please add more emojis to it.
2. Is there some sort of architecture diagram you can do of the code, for me to better understand the moving parts? If yes, please use a mermaid graph and add it to a new "Architecture Diagram"
```
