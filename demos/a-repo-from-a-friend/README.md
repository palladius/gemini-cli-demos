Image a friend tells you "Hey I wrote this amazing softwarem, can you give it a go?".
You have no context on it. What can you do?
Gemini CLI comes to help

exampls: github.com/palladius/sandmold

ask gemini to
1. explain what it does
2. create a README with what it does, and how to run it.
3. ask him to run it for you (if appliquable: app to run locally, or TF code to run in PLAN mode, and so on).
