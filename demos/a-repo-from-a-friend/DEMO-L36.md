# Demo L36 (master D&D)


Let's refactor the first prompt in the demo.

## Code understanding into CC

I've already created a sample file (empty to works with it)

```bash
# TODO empty when it works..
cp .gemini/commands/understand-random-repo.toml.empty .gemini/commands/understand-random-repo.toml
```

2. Copy the content

3. Edit away.

## Lets test it now!

1. Restart `gemini --yolo` (we're noe L36, we sk)
2. Type:

```
/understand-random-repo https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo
```



## Lets do more

```
1. The README is boring. Please add more emojis to it.
2. Is there some sort of architecture diagram you can do of the code, for me to better understand the moving parts? If yes, please use a mermaid graph and add it to a new "Architecture Diagram"
```
