## Ideas

* Explain git history of last 3 days of the downloaded repo. Anything from Allen or Riccardo? 
* Create a small `ABOUT.md` explaining what the random repo does. Plus add a small table with relevant info (git repo on github, stars, and other key values you deem important).

* How many commits in the past month? Show me a table with committers with a top 10 of Top committers, as you'd do in group by/count in sql.

I’ve heard they deprecated the -c (Checkpoint) command, I’m so sad! Can you find in which commit this happened and give me committer, timestamp and GH issue? 

Also I believe the docs still points to this deprecated command, can you help me file a PR to update the docs and reflect the new status?
