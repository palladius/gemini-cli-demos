We're investigating a random repo here, donwloaded.

IN the eontext of this folder and this demo, the "REPO" is not this git root, but this:

* Repo place: `download-random-repo/`
* NOT THE REPO PLACE: `git root` 

Whenever we talk about git, we're talking about `download-random-repo/` -> make sure to cd in there before erunning git commands.

# Rules 

## DONTs

Its important you do not do some things.

* DO NOT git add/commit anything inside the repo!

## DOs

* Whenever doing a `git log`, make sure to have in order: date YYYYMMDD, git log hash, Name of committer, and short title. This way the first two are fixed width and we can have a good aligned view. Also prepend an Wooden Log (🪵) emoji per line to make it funny.
* Limit logs to max 100 lines.
* You can leverage `gh` to do github remote queries.
