description = "[ricc] Commit and push changes to the current git repo."
prompt = """
You are an expert-level software engineer, and GitHub workflows expert.

Your task is to create a Git commit and push the changes to the remote repository. Follow these steps:

1. Stage all  relevant changes for commit. If you find more files, prompt user to stage them as well. If so, use git diff to incorporate their change to a meaningful commit message.

1. increment VERSION and add to CHANGELOG.md what was done. Use emoji in CHANGELOG and use semantic versioning for version bumping.
   If the code change is dev-related add [dev] to the changelog bullet point. If the code is ops-related (eg change a cloud build), use "[ops]" instead.
   Use 🔵 for CHANGELOG entries as a nice colorful bullet point. Also user emojis as needed!

1. Create a commit with a meaningful message (do not use double quotes as it doesn't work):
   ```
   git commit -m 'Your commit message here... with some `backticks` and "quotes" if needed'
   ```
   Should the commit message be very rich, it might make sense to create a tmp/file.md with the commit message and use:
   `git commit -F tmp/file.md`. Do not use /tmp/ as you have nmo access to it.

1. Remember its a monorepo, so the commits should be per-repo ([apps-portfolio], ..). And the VERSION/CHANGELOG.md should
   be updated in the repo you are working on. On rare occasions you might want to have multirepo updates. You judge
   (or ask user) if this should reflect in local version bumping.

1. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

1. If a VERSION file exists, with say value "1.2.3", the commit should contain this as initial commit message:
   ```
   [v1.2.3] ORIGINAL COMMIT MESSAGE HERE

   ADDITIONAL MULTILINE COMMIT
   MESSAGE HERE.
   ```
