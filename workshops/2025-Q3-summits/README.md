# Gemini CLI *beautiful* workshop

<!-- ![Beautiful Workshop](image.png) -->

![alt text](image-2.png)

To do this workshop, you need two things:

1. A GitHub account (optional but recommended)
2. `Gemini CLI` installed. Tranquillo, if you don't, we can work on that.

And of course, a computer connected to the internet.

## Installing Gemini CLI

You can install Gemini CLI on any machine, via `npm/npx`, even `brew` if you're on Mac.

1. Go to https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
2. Follow instructions.

## Getting started: download the code

If you do have a GitHub account:

1. **Fork** this repo: https://github.com/palladius/gemini-cli-demos
2. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/gemini-cli-demos`

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can just download the repo

1. Go to https://github.com/palladius/gemini-cli-demos#
2. Click Code > "Download ZIP"
3. You can take it from there.

**Finally** (in the Java sense of the word), you should have the code unzipped/cloned in a local `path/to/gemini-cli-demos`.
If you use a UI, like VSCode, Netbeans, Zed, or so, make sure to open it at the right unzipped/cloned folder, like

* `[code|zed|..] path/to/gemini-cli-demos/`


## The workshop

I hope your energy levels are good! We're getting started!

1. Ensure you have your favorite IDE open (if you use one).
2. ensure to `cd path/to/gemini-cli-demos` if you didnt follow the previous step. You should be in a folder with a `GEMINI.md`, a `README.md`, a `justfile` and other. It's important you call gemini from THIS folder, or scripts wont work!
3. Let's now call `$ gemini` on your local shell.
4. To start the workshop, do something like this: `/workshops:01_create_issue What do you want to do`. Examples:

```bash
# Example 1: app creation
/workshops:01_create_issue I want to vibe code a new app with Astro which tracks clicks from participants. Ensure a github issue tracks this.
# Example 2: git history
/workshops:01_create_issue I want to check the git history of this repo.
# Example 3: disk space
/workshops:01_create_issue Tell me how much disk space do I have? What are the biggest folders and how do i clean them up?
# Example 3: DB
/workshops:01_create_issue Help me create a SQLite DB called workshop-test.db with 3 tables called Orders, Items, Customers. Make sure the tables are linked. Finally create a db_schema.md with a mermaid graph of the schema, and help me commit to the repo.
# Example 3: Planning a new app: PRD + Implementation plan.
/workshops:01_create_issue Help me write the PRD for a new application to track participants clicks, so that the firs click returns a different PIN number. Every click will be tracked (IP, timestamp, PIN given). No login needed. Ask user for a preferred language/framework. If nothing is chosen, use Rails. Track this plan in a markdown and let the user review and commit after the user is happy. Some refinement will be needed. DO NOT IMPLEMENT anything, the output is a clicking-app-plan-PRD.md. When the user is happy, create a MD checklist clicking-app-plan-IMPLEMENTATION.md with the activities that need to be done. Finally commit the two files and link them in a new issue for ease of tracking.
```
Decide the authentication you want to have, the simplest is to use a gmail account login. You can swap auth via `/auth`.


## [optional] Now your turn to create automation!

Did you like what you see? Now you can try things yourself!

### [optional]  Write your own `GEMINI.md`

Did you notice some aspect where Gemini misbehaved? Or you want to extend/improve something? time to create your first GEMINI.md!

1. Create a GEMINI.md in the root folder or your git repo.
2. Add some sentences. Something as simple as "Speak to me in Italian" or "add some emoji" or "call me Aladeen", or something more pertinent to your coding flow ("Ensure unit tests are there", "Before committing, always remember to run local tests", ..)
3. Now reload `gemini` or run a `/memory refresh` or say "Please re-read @GEMINI.md". Don't forget the at ('@')!

### [optional]  Write your own Custom command

Did you enjoy my Custom commands, like `/workshops:01_create_issue` ? Time to write your own!

1. Check `.commands/commands/`. Look around for files: `find .commands/commands/`. Check also [workshops/01_create_issue.toml](https://github.com/palladius/gemini-cli-demos/blob/main/.gemini/commands/workshops/01_create_issue.toml) itself!
2. Create your own like `.commands/commands/YOURNAME/my_first_cmd.toml`. Say your name is "Julia", something like: `.commands/commands/julia/my_first_cmd.toml`.
3. Check any other TOML in there, as you can see you need to have a `description` and a `prompt`. Add your business logic to the prompt. Also use `{{args}}` to paste what the user will give you when invoking the command.
4. Once you're happy, restart `gemini`.
5. Try writing `/julia:my_first_cmd yellow is my favorite color` (or any other comment).
6. Enjoy Gemini following instructions in your TOML prompt, substituting "yellow is my favorite color" to the {{args}}.
7. Test this also in headless mode! just run `gemini -p "/julia:my_first_cmd yellow is my favorite color"`. Note you might want to give your command some super powers. `--yolo` will let it do ANYTHING (dangerous).
