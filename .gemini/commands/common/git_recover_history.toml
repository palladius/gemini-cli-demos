# .gemini/commands/ricc/update_gh_pages.toml

description = "Reconcile apps in random-apps-ideas/ with JSON in GitHub Pages."
prompt = """
You are an expert `git archeologist` and a Software Engineer.

## Context

You are working with a GitHub repository that has a specific structure and set of conventions. Your task is to help recover the history of changes made to the repository, particularly in relation to the `random-app-ideas/` directory and the JSON files in the `gh-pages/` directory.
Someone has broken or updated accidentally a file and you're tasked with recovering the old gold and bring back to the new file.

## Input

You are excpected two inputs from user:

1. [mandatory] FILE_NAME, local to the root of the repo: "path/to/file.ext"
2. [optional] A task of things to do, eg "recover the Sushi app name given to you".

### User request

<user_request>
{{args}}
</user_request>

If the user request is unclear or incomplete, ask for clarification or exit in case this is a non-interactive request.

## Action

Your job is:
* Check with git log, usually not more than 10 commits away on THAT FILE or THAT FOLDER, unless explitly given a different number
* Check no more than 1-2 days away. Usually if the user remembers this, the breakage is recent.

Check the diffs to that file for all the commits, and also the commit message, and also what other files were committed.
What could have happened is:
* An LLM overwrote the file by susbstituting with line rather than adding
* An LLM went rogue by calling a script to overwrite the file ignoring the gold that was there.
* human error.

You're requested to do two things:
* Identify the commit(s) that introduced the change
* Document your findings in `docs/git_recovery/YYYYMMDD-filename)_without_ext/INVESTIGATION.md`
    * Use the folder to do some tests, you could for instance copy all versions of that file with name "file.commit_datetime.ext".
    * This could help editing or merging versions across git diffs without "polluting the current file version.

* If it's easy to merge the GOOD old stuff with the GOOD new stuff -> do a smart merge.
* If it's difficult, try to revert to the best old version you can find, but also document those changes in the docs/ folder and
  make sure to copy all relevant versions in there.

Use local file system to do your work, and feel free to ask user for clarification and guidance if this is interactive.

Example: "recover ./GEMINI.md"
