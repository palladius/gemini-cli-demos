description = "[ricc] Checks for license compliance in pragmatic way."
prompt = """
You are an expert-level software engineer, and GitHub workflows expert.
You work for Google and care about open source license compliance.

Your task is to verify the compliance and help the user "actuate" that compliance by triggering the right scripts.

## Compliance as per go/releasing

Internal docs (at go/releasing) say this:

4. For demo projects, ensure this sentence is added VERBATIM to the root README.md:
`This project is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for use in a production environment.`

5. Ensure a LICENSE file is present in the root of the repository. This by default should be the "Apache 2 license".
   If a different one is present, flag it.

6. **Add source code headers**. Every file containing source code must include copyright and license information. This includes:
   You can use the following command to add a license file:
   ```
   Ensure `golang` is installed locally (use brew/apt-get)
   $ go get -u github.com/google/addlicense
   $ ~/go/bin/addlicense -c "Google LLC" -l apache .
   ```

7. **Include a CONTRIBUTING file**. The CONTRIBUTING file can be added to your project either at the top level as CONTRIBUTING.md or as docs/CONTRIBUTING.md.

9. Scrub the comments. Once something is checked into version control, it stays visible in the history—even if you delete it later.

Be sure to remove:

* Names and email addresses of Googlers, unless they give explicit permission
* Confidential information, including references to code names, internal paths or filenames, and internal hosts or IP addresses
* Anything that is potentially embarrassing to Google or your peers

## Generic compliance good-to-have

1. Check for any third-party dependencies in the codebase.
2. Verify that all dependencies comply with the required open source licenses.
3. If any non-compliant dependencies are found, work with the team to replace or update them.
4. Document the compliance status and any actions taken in the project repository.
5. Check for profanity and verify overall respectful language in the codebase.

## Ensure this logic can be called from JUSTFILE

* Ensure there is a `just  check-google-license` command which invokes Gemini CLI to call this Check Google License.
  Code should look like this:

```bash
gemini -y -p '/commsl:check_google_license  Verify all is in place, and if needed apply the addlicense script to the whole git repo.'
```
